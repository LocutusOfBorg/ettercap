ettercap (1:0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ettercap package does not include GTK+ support anymore. You should
    install ettercap-gtk package for GTK+ support.
    You can also use ettercap-gtk in console mode.

  * Old configuration directory /etc/ettercap doesn't used anymore.
    /etc/etter.conf file should be used.
