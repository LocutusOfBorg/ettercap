%description
@PROG@ is a network sniffer/interceptor/logger for ethernet LANs (both switched or not).
It supports active and passive dissection of many protocols (even ciphered ones, like
SSH and HTTPS). Data injection in an established connection and filtering (substitute
or drop a packet) on the fly is also possible, keeping the connection sincronized. Many
sniffing modes were implemented to give you a powerful and complete sniffing suite.
Plugins are supported. It has the ability to check whether you are in a switched LAN or
not, and to use OS fingerprints (active or passive) to let you know the geometry of the LAN.
The passive scan of the lan retrives infos about: hosts in the lan, open ports, services
version, type of the host (gateway, router or simple host) and extimated distance in hop.
